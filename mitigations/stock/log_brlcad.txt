#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#
Benchmark results indicate an approximate VGR performance metric of 52965
Logarithmic VGR metric is 4.72  (natural logarithm is 10.88)
#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

These numbers seem to indicate that this machine is approximately 52965 times
faster than the reference machine being used for comparison, a VAX 11/780
running 4.3 BSD named VGR.  These results are in fact approximately 4.72
orders of magnitude faster than the reference.

Here are some other approximated VGR results for perspective:

#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#
Benchmark results indicate an approximate VGR performance metric of 53302
Logarithmic VGR metric is 4.73  (natural logarithm is 10.88)
#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

These numbers seem to indicate that this machine is approximately 53302 times
faster than the reference machine being used for comparison, a VAX 11/780
running 4.3 BSD named VGR.  These results are in fact approximately 4.73
orders of magnitude faster than the reference.

Here are some other approximated VGR results for perspective:
    120 on a 200MHz R5000 running IRIX 6.5
    250 on a 500 MHz Pentium III running RedHat 7.1
    550 on a dual 450 MHz UltraSPARC II running SunOS 5.8

Benchmark results indicate an approximate VGR performance metric of 53476
Logarithmic VGR metric is 4.73  (natural logarithm is 10.89)
#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

These numbers seem to indicate that this machine is approximately 53476 times
faster than the reference machine being used for comparison, a VAX 11/780
running 4.3 BSD named VGR.  These results are in fact approximately 4.73
orders of magnitude faster than the reference.

Here are some other approximated VGR results for perspective:
    120 on a 200MHz R5000 running IRIX 6.5
    250 on a 500 MHz Pentium III running RedHat 7.1
    550 on a dual 450 MHz UltraSPARC II running SunOS 5.8
   1000 on a dual 500 MHz G4 PowerPC running Mac OS X 10.2
   1500 on a dual 1.66 GHz Athlon MP 2000+ running RedHat 7.3
  52000 on a 4x4 CPU 2.93 GHz Xeon running RHEL Server 5.4
  65000 on a 512 CPU 400 MHz R12000 Running IRIX 6.5

WARNING: This may not be an optimized compilation of BRL-CAD.
Performance results may not be optimal.

Official benchmark results are optimized builds with all run-time
features enabled and optionally without compile-time debug symbols.

For proper results, run 'make clean' and recompile with the
following configure options added:
  --enable-optimized
